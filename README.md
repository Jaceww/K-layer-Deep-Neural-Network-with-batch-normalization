# K-layer-Deep-Neural-Network-with-batch-normalization
#### Train  and  test k-layer  networks  with  multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
1. Generalizes the code so that it can train and test k-layer networks.
2. Incorporates batch normalization into the k-layer network both for training and testing.
